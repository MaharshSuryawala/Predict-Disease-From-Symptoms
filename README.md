### Overview

* According to a recent study carried out by [BMJ quality and safety](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/), 12 million adults who seek medical care are misdiagnosed each year in the United States. 
* The accumulation of large case loads and incomplete medical histories lead to rise in human-errors. 
* An Artificial Intelligent system can predict and diagnose a disease at a faster and more efficient way as compared to medical professionals. 
* In the following project we will be predicting diseases from symptoms using machine learning algorithms like decision tree and random forests. 
* Moreover, we will try to plot the diseases and symptoms and create a network graph to analyse the common symptoms between diseases, most common symtoms, most common diseases etc.  

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

### Dataset

Source: [Disease-Symptom Knowledge Database](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html)
  
  * The data set consists of 148 diseases with their corresponding symptoms. 
  * The data set also included the count of disease occurences.  
  
## Results

### Disease-Symptoms Network

### Decision Tree
